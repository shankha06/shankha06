  <h1>Hello, I'm Roy üëã</h1>
</div>

I'm an **Applied AI/ML Lead** passionate about pushing the boundaries of machine learning. My focus is on learning, implementing, and scaling ML techniques to solve real-world problems. I thrive on exploring the cutting edge and bringing innovative solutions to life.

### üöÄ Key Expertise & Interests

* **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Fine-tuning, prompt engineering, hybrid-RAG, domain adaptation.
* **Recommendation Engines:** Building and optimizing personalized recommendation systems, including collaborative filtering, content-based, hybrid models, and learning-to-rank.
* **Computer Vision:** Developing models for image classification, object detection and image embeddings.
* **Exploring New Frontiers:** Always curious and eager to dive into emerging ML research and unconventional applications.

### üõ†Ô∏è Featured Repositories

I enjoy building tools and experimenting with ML concepts. Here are a couple of projects you might find interesting:

* **[enigma-engines](https://github.com/shankha06/enigma-engines):** Welcome to Enigma Engines! This is my playground for experimenting with machine learning models on real datasets in my spare time. Currently, it features an agent-based simulation inspired by Animal Crossing, where the agent optimizes actions to increase villager friendship and earnings. I'm also developing a recommendation engine within this project to simulate optimal item suggestions based on user session history.
* **[utility](https://github.com/shankha06/magical-utility):** This repository houses a collection of reusable Python utilities designed to simplify downstream processes. You'll find handy tools like rich print samples, enhanced pandas DataFrame interaction with `rich`, dynamic progress bars, folder zipping functions, and a script to search and download images from Unsplash.
